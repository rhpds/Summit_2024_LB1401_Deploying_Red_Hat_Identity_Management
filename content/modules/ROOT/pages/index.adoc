Welcome to {lab_name}!  We're happy you've joined us for Red Hat Summit 2024.  Whether you are new to Identity Manager (IdM) deployments, or a seasoned IdM administrator, we hope you learn something new about deploying, managing, and maintaining IdM in this lab.

== Basics

Red Hat IdM runs on top of a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) server.  No additional entitlement or subscription is required.  IdM is included with RHEL.  If you have a RHEL subscription, you will be able to take most of what you learn in this lab and apply it on your own in your environment.  

We will also cover Windows Active Directory trusts.  This of course requires a licence from Microsoft to do on your own.  

== What will we cover today?

In this lab we will show you how to automate deployments of IdM using the `rhel_idm` or the `ansible-freeipa` role.  This role can be leveraged to deploy a brand new system, add in replicas, clients, domain trusts, and continue the ongoing maintenance of your deployment.  

We will cover:

* Laying some groundwork for our deployment.
* Deploying a basic IdM environment and configuring it with the `rhel_idm` role, with it.
* Adding a client machine to your new IdM domain.
* Configuring a Microsoft Windows system and a Microsoft Active Directory trust with your IdM domain.
* Adding in an IdM replica to an existing domain.


=== Lab Access

The terminal window to your right is *already* logged into the lab environment as the `{ssh_user}` user via `ssh`. 
All steps of this lab are to be completed as the `{ssh_user}` user on the bastion server.

To access the IdM GUI once you have installed it in `Step 1`, you will need to open a browser, got to settings, type "proxy" in the search bar in the top right corner and click settings. Select "Manual proxy configuration" and go to "SOCKS Host" and put in localhost and for the "Port" put in 5060. Finally check the checkbox for "Proxy DNS when using SOCKS v5".

Finally you will need to open a terminal window and ssh -D 5060 -C -N {ssh_command}
